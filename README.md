Impact of zinc deficiency on Group B Streptococcal colonization and the vaginal microbiome

Qiita study - 13660

Abstract
Group B Streptococcus (GBS) in the vaginal tract is associated with increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. GBS colonization is transient in nature, likely reflecting contributions of pathogen determinants, interactions with commensal flora, and host factors, making this environment particularly challenging to understand. Zinc deficiency is a global concern largely associated with preterm birth but the impact of zinc deficiency on vaginal health has not been studied. Here we use a murine model of GBS vaginal colonization to assess the role of dietary zinc deficiency on GBS burden and impacts on the vaginal microbiome. We show vaginal community turnover during GBS colonization that is driven by computationally predictable changes in key taxa. We identified that Akkermansia muciniphila impacts GBS murine colonization and is associated with birth outcome in a human cohort. These findings reveal the importance and complexity of zinc availability and host microbiome to GBS vaginal persistence.
